	<p>Nayuta is a fair-skinned boy with short ruffled hair and purple bluish eyes. His hair is white with purple tips and sticks out from all sides of his head. Nayuta wears a jacket with multiple colors such as turquoise, blue and purple and the jacket is adorned with the cozmez logo and wording. Underneath his jacket, Nayuta also wears a white belt choker like Kanata. He has white shorts and socks with the cozmez logo and a pair of turquoise, blue and purple sneakers. To complete his look, he adorns a snake earring on his right ear that looks as if it's slithering all across his ear, which is identical to Kanata's.</p>
	<p>For the 1st anniversary, Nayuta was seen wearing new clothes while still retaining his old accessory. He now wears a black tank top with snakes and flowers printed onto a purple and teal jersey, as well as light blue shorts with their own flower pattern. His footwear consists of white socks with purple and teal lining, and purple and teal sneakers with opposite lace color. Nayuta later wears a black fuzzy hat with the cozmez logo and his choker is now black instead of white.</p>
